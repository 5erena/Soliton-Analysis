# Soliton-Analysis

This data and code was apart of a project which examined the properties of solitons and how they behave in isolated systems. This code compares experimental measurements of the speed-amplitude relation with theoretical predictions. The conduit equation is solved analytically to obtain a theoretical speed-amplitude relation and then plotted numerically. This is compared with the speed-amplitude relation observed through the experimental data, through which an experimental relation is derived. From there, the equation describing a traveling solitary wave is solved numerically using Eulerâ€™s Method. The numerical solution is then compared with the experimental observations to ascertain whether the theoretical predictions were a decent approximation to the observed experimental results.

Data is in MATLAB format, which is converted within Python code.
